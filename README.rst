lichess_ is a Python library for interacting with the `Lichess API <https://lichess.org/api>`_ and can be used to get profile data, game data, and much more.

    **This project is still in Pre-Alpha. As a result, it is still unstable and not all features have been implemented.**

Click `here <https://lichess.readthedocs.io>`_ for the full documentation for this package.

|

=======
Install
=======
You can install lichess_ on the Terminal (macOS/UNIX) or the Command Prompt (Windows) with::

    pip install lichess

Alternatively, you can use Git to clone the repository from GitHub with::

    git clone https://github.com/qe/lichess.git
    cd lichess
    pip install .

Or, if you already have it, upgrade to the latest version with::

    pip install lichess --upgrade

|

=======
Example
=======
For the full documentation, please check the `Lichess Python API Documentation <https://lichess.readthedocs.io>`_.

Some methods, such as ``Client.get_email()``, require authorization while others, such as ``Client.get_leaderboard()``,
do not require it. As a result, if you want to use a method/endpoint that does require authorization, you will need to
`generate a personal access token on Lichess <https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token>`_. If you do so, this will be your API Key.

To determine whether or nor you need to generate a personal access token, check
the `Lichess API Documentation <https://lichess.org/api>`_ if the endpoint your interested in using has a OAuth2 badge.

Here is an example of using lichess_ **with** an personal access token:
::

    import lichess

    API_KEY = "<YOUR API KEY GOES HERE>"
    myclient = lichess.Client(token=API_KEY)

    print(myclient.get_email())

::

    {'email': 'youremailwillshowuphere@gmail.com'}


Here is an example of using lichess_ **without** a personal access token:
::

    import lichess

    myclient = lichess.Client()

    print(myclient.get_data("ismodes"))

::

Warnings
========

    **Make sure your inputs are valid.**

There is basic error handling for some invalid inputs, but there are exceptions.


Firstly, there are many types of invalid inputs. Here is an example:

- Usernames that don't exist
    - Valid username, but no user has taken it
    - Invalid username

lichess_ does basic error handling with invalid inputs (using Regex), but it does not
account for valid inputs that do not exist. Here is a more explicit example:

``"jzq0wUnCYR"`` is a valid username (i.e. it can be registered), but at the time of writing this,
there is no user by this name. As a result, the following code does not return everything:
::

    import lichess

    myclient = lichess.Client()

    print(myclient.get_status("jzq0wUnCYR", "penguingim1"))

::

    [{'name': 'penguingim1', 'title': 'GM', 'patron': True, 'id': 'penguingim1'}]


Conversely, ``"jzq0 wUnCYR"`` is an invalid username, since it has invalid characters (note the whitespace!)
However, lichess_ does catch this error, as seen below:
::

    import lichess

    myclient = lichess.Client()

    print(myclient.get_status("jzq0 wUnCYR", "penguingim1"))

::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "main.py", line 109, in <module>
        main()
      File "main.py", line 76, in main
        print(myclient.get_status("jzq0 wUnCYR", "penguingim1"))
      raise ArgumentValueError("One or more usernames are invalid.")
    lichess.exceptions.ArgumentValueError: One or more usernames are invalid.

It is your responsibility to make sure your inputs are valid, but lichess_ tries its best to catch errors <3
