lichess_ is a Python library for interacting with the `Lichess API <https://lichess.org/api>`_ and can be used to get profile data, game data, and much more.

    **This project is still in Pre-Alpha. As a result, it is still unstable, and not all features have been implemented.**


|

============
Installation
============
You can install lichess_ on the Terminal (macOS/UNIX) or the Command Prompt (Windows) with::

    pip install lichess

Alternatively, you can use Git to clone the repository from GitHub with::

    git clone https://github.com/qe/lichess.git
    cd lichess
    pip install .

Or, if you already have it, upgrade to the latest version with::

    pip install lichess -U

|

=====
Usage
=====

For the full documentation, please check the `Lichess Python API Documentation <https://lichess-api.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Some methods, such as ``Client.get_email()``, require authorization while others, such as ``Client.get_leaderboard()``,
do not require it. As a result, if you want to use a method/endpoint that does require authorization, you will need to
`generate a personal access token on Lichess <https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token>`_. If you do so, this will be your API Key.

To determine whether or nor you need to generate a personal access token, check if the endpoint you are interested in
using has a OAuth2 badge in the `Lichess API Documentation <https://lichess.org/api>`_.

Here is an example of using lichess_ **without** a personal access token:
::

    import lichess

    myclient = lichess.Client()


Here is an example of using lichess_ **with** a personal access token:
::

    import lichess

    API_KEY = "<YOUR API KEY GOES HERE>"
    myclient = lichess.Client(token=API_KEY)

==============
Quick Examples
==============

The following are some examples of popular uses of this package:

|

Get the profile data of a user

::

    myclient = lichess.Client()

    user = myclient.get_data("bmartin")


Get the rating history of a user

::

    myclient = lichess.Client()

    history = myclient.get_rating_history("agadmator")


Get the list of users that are offline, online, and playing

::

    myclient = lichess.Client()

    users = ["Oliver_Penrose", "bmartin", "ismodes", "penguingim1", "Zhigalko_Sergei"]
    data = myclient.get_status(users)

    offline = [i['name'] for i in data if 'online' not in i.keys()]
    online = [i['name'] for i in data if 'online' in i.keys()]
    playing = [i['name'] for i in data if 'playing' in i.keys()]


Download all the games of a user

::

    myclient = lichess.Client()

    games = myclient.export_by_user(<USERNAME GOES HERE>)

    with open("games.pgn", "w") as f:
        f.write(games)
    f.close()


Get the list of all the members of a team

::

    API_KEY = "<YOUR API KEY GOES HERE>"
    myclient = lichess.Client(token=API_KEY)

    members = myclient.get_team_members(<TEAMNAME GOES HERE>)


Get the list of all the IDs of the puzzles you have failed

::

    API_KEY = "<YOUR API KEY GOES HERE>"
    myclient = lichess.Client(token=API_KEY)

    activity = myclient.get_puzzle_activity()
    failed = [i['id'] for i in activity if not i['win']]
